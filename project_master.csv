PRJ-P001,PNAS paper,Bacterial microbiome of soil and rhizosphere in organic agricultural field,"This project focuses on a bacterial profiling of several organic/chemical fertilizers and soil solarization effects on Japanese mustard spinach (Brassica rapa var. perviridis). To this end, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for soils and rhizosphere including root tissues at harvest stage with two replicates for each experimental plot in the Japanese agricultural field planted with Japanese mustard spinach. We also collected the data of NMR-based metabolomics and ICP-OES-based ionomics as well as plant phenotypic data in the same experimental plots, which will be integrated based on a correlation network analysis to reveal interactions between plant growth and environmental factors in organic agricultural field.","The PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JPMJPR15Q2), and the Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “Technologies for Smart Bio-industry and Agriculture” (funding agency: Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution, NARO)",P001,Targeted Locus (Loci),Environment,Partial Genome,Targeted Locus/Loci,Sequencing,Sequence,"rhizosphere metagenome, soil metagenome"
